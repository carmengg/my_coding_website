I am a Mathematics PhD candidate at the University of California in Santa Barbara  looking to apply my analytic and coding expertise to ecology and environmental science. Being convinced that scientific research can and should play a leading role in protecting nature, I’m exploring career paths that will allow me to my data science and mathematical modeling skills to an interdisciplinary working group that addresses environmental issues. 


In my free time I love birding and trying out new hiking trails in Santa Barbara.
