I am a Mathematics PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  
Currently I am learning about environmental data science taking classes at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. 

After obtaining my PhD I would like to use my mathematics and coding background to become part of an interdisciplinary research group that addresses environmental issues. 

In my free time I love birding and trying out new hiking trails in Santa Barbara.
