I'm Carmen, a Mathematics PhD candidate at the University of California in Santa Barbara. 
<!-- After spending looking to apply my analytic and coding expertise to ecology and environmental science. -->
I am excited to enter a career path that will allow me to use my data science, coding expertise and analytical problem-solving skills in an interdisciplinary working group. 
<!-- that addresses environmental issues. -->
In my free time you can find me birding or trying out new hiking trails in Santa Barbara.
