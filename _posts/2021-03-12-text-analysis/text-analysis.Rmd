## Introduction
This is a text analysis on the The Little Prince,  written and illustrated by Antoine de Saint Exupéry. We use the translation from the French by Katherine Woods.

## Text wrangling

```{r, code_folding= TRUE }
# --- READ IN TEXT ---
prince_text <- pdf_text("TheLittlePrince.pdf")

# --- TEXT CLEANING ---
prince_tokens <- data.frame(prince_text) %>%   # convert to data frame
  mutate(text_full = str_split(prince_text,pattern="\\n")) %>%  #split by line
  unnest(text_full) %>% # make each line into a string
  mutate(text_full = str_trim(text_full)) %>%  # remove extra spaces
  unnest_tokens(word, text_full) %>%           # make a column with each word as a row
  select(word) %>%      # keep the words
  anti_join(stop_words) # remove stop words

```

## Word cloud of most used words
The word "prince", which is the most frequently used word in the text, is excluded from this analysis. To make the wordcloud I used the `ggworldcloud` library.

```{r, code_folding= TRUE }
# --- TOP 100 WORDS WORD CLOUD ---

# select top 100 words
top_100_words <- prince_tokens %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(2:101) %>%   # remove prince (#1 word with 179 counts)
  mutate(angle = 45 * sample(-2:2, n(), # add random angles to words
                             replace = TRUE, 
                             prob = c(1, 1, 4, 1, 1))) 

top_100_words$angle[1]=45

# wordcloud graph
ggplot(top_100_words, aes(label = word, 
                          size = n,
                          color = factor(sample.int(10, nrow(top_100_words), replace = TRUE)),
                          angle = angle)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud_area() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  labs(title="Most used words in The Little Prince")+
  theme_void()
```


```{r, preview=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, layout="l-page", fig.height=100, fig.width=100}

knitr::include_graphics(here("_posts","2021-03-12-text-analysis","word_cloud.png"))

```

## Sentiment analysis

To do the sentiment analysis we used the NRC lexicon, which assigns to each word one of 10 sentiments and/or a negative or positive tag. As we might have suspected, The Little Prince is quite a positive book and feelings most often associated to it according to the NRC lexicon are trust, anticipation and joy. 

```{r, code_folding= TRUE }
nrc_count <- prince_tokens %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>% 
  count(sentiment)

ggplot(data=nrc_count, aes(x=fct_reorder(sentiment,n), # order from high to low count 
                           y=n))+
  geom_col(color='darkslateblue', fill='darkslateblue')+
  coord_flip() +
  labs( x = "sentiment",
    y = "words with given sentiment",
          title = "Sentiment analysis in 'The Little Prince' by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry")+
  theme_minimal()
```



```{r, preview=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics(here("_posts",
                             "2021-03-12-text-analysis",
                             "sentiment_count.png"))

```
